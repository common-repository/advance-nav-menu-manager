Adds a 'Advance Nav Menu Manager' copy, move, duplicate menu WordPress plugin.

== Description ==

Advance Nav Menu Manager is to assist with menu management. Usually speaking, there are no choices to copy, relocate, or replicate menus when using the standard menu navigation functions. For instance, if I wish to add all services of header menu to footer menu, I need to add manually to footer menu. If I have this plugin than I can easily copy the services to footer menu.


Features
• Easy installation
• Show all features in the default menu option in the WordPress menu page.
• Copy, move, and duplicate menu item buttons in the menu page
• Free support
